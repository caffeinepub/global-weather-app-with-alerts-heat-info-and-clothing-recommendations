  "summary": "REQ-8 (frontend global location search UI) appears implemented via a new LocationSearch component backed by Open-Meteo geocoding results, including multi-result dropdown, selection callback with lat/lon, updated placeholder text, and a no-results message. REQ-9 (backend removal of blessed-location restriction) is not implemented; backend getCoordinates still returns the hardcoded Berlin location and does not perform global lookup.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Remove the backend restriction that only allows \"blessed\" locations; update backend/main.mo so location lookup no longer traps for non-Berlin/San-Francisco inputs and can return coordinates for valid global queries (e.g., Tokyo/Cairo/Sydney).",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo still uses hardcoded blessed locations and getCoordinates ignores the input and always returns blessedBerlin, so it does not enable global lookup and cannot satisfy the test queries acceptance criteria.",
